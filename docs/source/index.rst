PyFieldImager
=============

A Python package for field image analysis.

- This package manages field images (such as orthophoto, Digital Surface Model (DSM) and Digital Terrain Model (DTM)) as field image object.
- This package can identify vegetation and soil extent using vegetation indices (e.g. NDVI, VARI, SCI).
- It can also calculate the height distribution (known as Canopy Height Model (CHM)) and projected/surface area of vegetation areas, and can create DTMs by missing value completion.
